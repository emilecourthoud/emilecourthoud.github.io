# Hack your brain, hack your life

**A guide to happiness**

### Hack your brain. Reject its directives

Life is full of forks and you normally start down the wrong path. Let's consider two examples.

It’s 7.30am and the alarm rings. You feel sleepy and postpone the alarm for five times. Half an hour later, you finally get up and grab a sugary doughnut to wake up your brain. You really want to get off to a good start and then watch an episode of your favorite Netflix series.

It's 9.30am and you are late for work. You hop on a Uber to get to the office faster, where everyone is already immersed in their work. Silently, you sit at your desk and rush off into work. Two hours later, your colleagues invite you for lunch. So far you have worked little and decide to order fast food and join your colleagues later to save some time. You catch up with your colleagues for the last 5 minutes of their lunch: two words, two forks and you're back at your desk.

You get the easy job done and now it is the turn of the tedious task. You delegate it to the new analyst and take a long cigarette break to relieve some stress. At 5.30pm, 

You get the easy work done and now it is the turn of the boring task. You delegate it to the new analyst and take a long cigarette break to release some stress. You then check the analysist work and completely off your expectations. You thus need to work till late to re-do it again. Stress out and tired, you take a second Uber to go home. You are tired for a listening to your wife discussions at dinner time and you just watch with her a second episode of your Netflix series. The day is over.

What a bad day. You ate again bad food, no sport at all, you spent a lot on transportation and food, no chat with friend and bad situation at home as well.

Let's re-rewind the story

It’s 7.30am and the alarm rings. You feel sleepy and wash you face to wake up. Your brain is now active but not your body: it's time for a run. You need to push your legs at the beginning but then they start moving sweetly. Afterward a shower, take the bike. On the way to work, you stop at the bakery and buy fresh croissants. You arrive at work and share the food and a chat with colleagues. For 9am, you are fresh and happy and work hard till lunch. You are done with you’re tasks and have cook food with you’re colleagues and share the cake together. In the afternoon you work hard because you want to surprise your wife. 

What an amazing day. What an amazing life.

Life is full of forks and you normally start down the wrong path.

Hack your brain. Separate you rational part from instincts. Then split again your instinct and irrational part of your brain in two: the lazy ass part and the mad man part. Use your rational part of your brain as judge, while the irrational part as decision-maker. After that your instinct decide what you should do, reject immidiately the decision if it comes from your lazy-ass, accepted and blend it if it comes from the creative-mad part.

<mind tree> separation of the brain

It is up to you to choose if you want to be happy. Everybody have similar tree in front, but only few have are mad enough to embrace an happy life. If you want to, blend your brain so that it becomes natural to you to stir your life towards a happy ending. Otherwise, give up and let your brain drag you towards the sad end, which happens as natural as gravity drag us towards the ground.

<choice tree>. Some actions proposed by the lazy ass, some from the mad-man. Pick one from the mad-man and blend it if too crazy. Propagate the tree  (SEE PICTURE)

In case you want to embrace some good principles, I recommend you to continue reading. Otherwise, feel free to listen to the lazy ass and go watching the third episode of your Netflix series ;).

### Open your mind. Open your eyes

Taming your brain is the key to happiness. First you need to understand how the tree is made, which branches uplifts you towards a mad happiness, which drags you down towards a sad depression. Afterwards, it becomes easy to trick your brain to pick the right choice every time. 

And how to unveil the tree of choices? This is very very tricky. You need to know yourself first, very deeply. Understand what brings you real joy and what is the fake joy. Let's make the example of ecstasy as a drug. This is the worst of the lazy ass recommendations. This is the choice in which you lazy ass tell you soul that you are a loser, showing that you do not know how to find happiness, and thus you try to cheat and buy it at a crazy price. You do not need to try strong drugs to understand the how idiot you are, you just need to talk to a addictive person first.
Let me re-structure the reasoning. You need to know the tree of choice to be able to understand its structure. You need to **open your mind and your eyes to the world**. Know as many people as possible. Know as many cultures as possible. Visit as many places as possible. Talk about as many topic as possible. Make as many experience as possible. And always listen instead of talking. Explore, try, learn... fail.

**Open your mind to differences** and enjoy differences: differences means something you do not know. If your goals is open your eyes to something new, differences are your gold mine. 

**Open your mind to criticisms**. Criticism is again linked to difference, the difference in point of view and approach. You may think that your are 100% correct, but receiving criticism means learning a new point of view. And learning is gold. Accept criticism, in particular if constructed criticisms. Always. Say thank you to people criticizing you. 

To be able to embrace criticism, you need to **fight back your ego**. Ego is as evil as the lazy ass, stopping you from learning. It's is good to have a some sort of ego, it may help you increase the confidence in yourself, but you must be able to tame it. Ego is what make you take a criticism as personal. You instead embrace criticism, take it as a push forward on your learning curve, a new challenge to be solved.

A good test to see if you know how to tame your ego is by see how often you genuinely say sorry and thank you. If you are able to blame yourself instead of blaming others, genuinely say sorry for your mistakes, take responsibility for your actions and say thank you to people criticizing your work, you will do a big step in your life.

### Do more, for less

You truly want to unveil the tree of choices. You have opened eyes and mind but this is not enough. You will never discover about yourself, your tree or the world if you continue to do the life you have always lived. 

You need to do more. You need to have some different experience. When you have the opportunity to do a new experience, let you mad-man tell you if it is new for you. As I said before, doing stupid stuff like having drugs, jumping from the last floor of a skyscrapers, spending all your money in slot machines are new experiences but should pass the go-nogo test of your rational part of the brain. As there is no easy-money, **there is no easy-happiness**. What you are interested in new experience. You have never organised  a big party? Do so this weekend. You have never sit on top of the city hill at night? Go this night. You have never talked to that homeless woman on the sidewalk of the street? You have been proposed a challenging tasks that you do not have a clue how to approach? Accept it, it will be your new challenge. Just go and sit with her for a hour. Your rational brain should be able to catch that there is little to learn, a treasure to win by trying this experiences.

You need to hack your brain and convince it to do the first step. It is difficult. No pain, no gain. You should start enjoy the hard life, thinking about the long term benefits instead of the immediate results. You want to run a marathon? The start training until you through up. You want to be successful in life? Then start studying day and night.

Do more, not expecting nothing back. Do not do a favour to your friend expecting a thank you back. Do not work for a company expecting compliments back from your colleagues. This is the lazy-ass coming back to you, hoping to get some easy-happiness. If you are giving money to a homeless guy on the streets, you should to it to help him, not because you want to go cheap to get an easy thank you from him. Same applies if you are making a favour to one of your friend. Keep the lazy-ass 

- Have experiences
- Have hobbies that characterise yourself. They do not be compatible with the society... who cares if nobody is interested in listening to you talking about them.
- Do more for less
- Help people, help the world
- Enjoy the journey, not the destination. Do not help for final goals. Do not work for money, but enjoy working, the money will come buy anyway. 
- Mens sana, corpore sana. Push your body. Do exercise. Push your body to the limit. Feel the adrenaline, feel the body crying. Feel the new life
- Enjoy the hard life. No pain, no gain.

### People, people, everywhere

**"Happiness is true when shared"**. What does this mean?

Many people think that happiness lies on the internal peace with yourself. Other that happiness is related to money or success. You may spen

Many people think that happiness lies on the internal peace and self. You may think that the happiness relies on you and finding the peace inside you. You may spend one year alone thinking about where to find happiness, then having a good laugh with a friend and realize that this laugh has just brought you all the happiness you were looking for. But then you think you have few friends able to make you laugh in that way. This means that you need to **surround yourself with the right people**. But then you realize that also with these people you usually share few good laughs. You go out, shatr. What then if you can keep being happy all the time? This should be 

Surround you with the right people

FOMO is a trap. 

Do not rely on few people

Do not rely of **few people** means that first you must rely **on some people**, has mentioned in point <people people>.

Assuming you reached this point, we  

Example of you rely on a single person that betrays you with respect to rely on 5 people. And if you rely on 5 people of your 25 people network? Generalization.



### Set your own principles

After some time, which could be months or years or decades, of trying to explore the tree of choices, you will realize that you'll realize that you will be already on the track towards happiness. When you will realize that, the feeling will be amazing. As you can learn how to cycle and cycle all you life, you will realize that you have learned how to be happy. 

 

Apart from that, 

Do not follow people.FOMO is a trap. Set your principles. Perfect them over your life. Do not let other people set them for you.

Be yourself. Be weird. Be yourself. Get some confidence. Take responsibility of your weird actions and be proud of them. You are not one person in the society. You are yourself. Be weird, be yourself. And don't play weird, just because somebody may enjoy that. That's FOMO again, such a losing strategy.

**Have a vision. Make it happen**. This dream could be anything that you can imagine be possible in the future. The dream can be changing over time. You grow, 

### Smile to life. And laugh, always

Once you opened your mind, set your mission and learned how to approach  to the final goal, there nothing else to do then smile. Smile and laugh, every moment of your life. Life is fun. Laugh for the smallest thing. Laugh at the fly that repeatedly hit the close window when there is another open nearby. Laugh at you mate when you see she/he is sad and cheer her up. Smile at the sun or at the lovely sound of the rain. You need nothing in you life to smile except for the your willingness to do so.
