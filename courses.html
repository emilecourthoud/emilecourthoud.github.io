      <h2>About me</h2>
      Welcome! Here is Emile.<br />
      I am a mechanical engineer by background, a management consultant by profession, a computer scientist by vocation, a dreamer by nature.<br />
      I come from Aosta Valley, a lovely spot in the heart of the Italian Alps. I grew up in the mountains, wandering in the woods, building tree houses and playing with fire. Risk and freedom, that is what I loved.<br />
      Then I discovered the city and opened my eyes. I discovered the people and opened my hearth. I discovered the world and opened my soul.<br />
      That is all, this is me.<br />
